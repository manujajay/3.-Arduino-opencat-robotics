# Arduino-OpenCat-Robotics

This repository is dedicated to the OpenCat project, an open-source platform for developing robotic cats using Arduino. It includes details on hardware assembly, programming, and tips for customization and control.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- An Arduino board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- Servo motors and other robot parts as per the OpenCat design
- Basic understanding of electronics and Arduino programming

## Installation

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. Clone this repository to get the required Arduino sketches and libraries:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github/arduino-opencat-robotics.git
   ```

3. Open the Arduino sketch for the OpenCat project in the Arduino IDE.

## Hardware Setup

- Assemble the robot according to the OpenCat design specifications.
- Connect the servo motors to the Arduino using a suitable driver or shield.
- Ensure all connections are secure and that the power supply is adequate for the servos and Arduino.

## Example - Basic Movement

The following code snippet demonstrates how to control a servo to simulate basic cat-like movements.

### `basic_movement.ino`

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>

Servo servo1;  // Create servo object to control a servo

void setup() {
  servo1.attach(9);  // Attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
  servo1.write(90);  // Set servo to mid-point
}

void loop() {
  servo1.write(180);  // Turn servo to 180 degrees
  delay(1000);        // Wait for 1 second
  servo1.write(0);    // Turn servo back to 0 degrees
  delay(1000);        // Wait for 1 second
}
```
